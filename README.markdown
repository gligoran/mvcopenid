# OpenID Starter Kit for ASP.NET MVC

## Overview
OpenID Starter Kit for ASP.NET MVC is first and foremost it is a learning tool. I've learned a lot about OpenID while developing this and commented the code a lot. If you want to use it in this way I running the application and stepping through the code. Apart from it's education value you can also use it as a starter kit for your ASP.NET MVC based web applications.

## Status and future plans
This project has just started so I will be adding more to it. Right now there is only the simple support for OpenID. 

In the future I hope to implement:

* Pop up window for signing in to you OpenID provider.
* AJAX pop up for signing in to you OpenID provider.
* Make all versions available for Razor and Web Froms view engines.
